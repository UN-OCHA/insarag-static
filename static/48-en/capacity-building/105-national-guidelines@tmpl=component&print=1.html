        	<p>The INSARAG Guidelines 2015 include a complete manual on strengthening national and local capacity building (<a href="../../images/stories/INSARAG_Guidelines_V2_Chapeau__Manual_A_-_Capacity_Building1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vol. II, Manual A</a>) and recommend countries<strong> to establish a national USAR team accreditation mechanism</strong> to allow a country to &ldquo;<em>manage, monitor and establish the same standards officially and adhere closely to the INSARAG standards and guidance in developing its USAR national response systems</em>&rdquo;. This process has been worked on particularly since 2014 in a workshop carried out in Chile on &ldquo;<a href="../../images/stories/Americas_good_practices/Sistema_acreditaciÃ³n_USAR_guidance_ENG_2014.09.29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The creation of a national USAR team accreditation process</a>&rdquo; and many of the lessons learned in the Americas region in the past few years have been incorporated.</p>
<p>The INSARAG Americas Regional Group presented a proposal on this topic to the INSARAG Steering Group in 2016, who in turn requested the Regional Group to lead the initiative to &ldquo;<em>design a peer revision/certification process of national USAR team accreditation processes, which confirms to the requesting country that it is complying with the minimum standards for national USAR team accreditation processes</em>&rdquo; and present recommendations back to the Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../global-structures/working-group/national-accreditation-working-group.html">National Accreditations Working Group</a>&nbsp;was created in 2016, led by the Americas Regional Group with participation from other interested countries, and the proposal developed and consulted globally throughout 2016 was endorsed by the INSARAG Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Classification vs Accreditation</strong><br />The INSARAG Guidelines 2015 make the difference between the IEC <span style="text-decoration: underline;">classification</span> &ndash; a process amongst peers, designed by the INSARAG community for the verification of the achievement of the standards for teams with an international deployment mandate; and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accreditation</span>, a process which is by definition at the national level and through which the achievement of national standards is certified by an accrediting entity, in other words, the competent national authorities.</p>
<p><strong>National accreditation process</strong><br />The USAR response framework of INSARAG shows a structure, which aims to ensure <strong>interoperability</strong> between <img src="../../images/Capacity_building/INSARAG_USAR_response_framework_ENG.png" alt="INSARAG USAR response framework ENG" width="250" height="170" style="float: right;" />different levels of USAR response and determines that "<em>it is vital that working practices, technical language and information are common and shared through all levels of the USAR response framework</em>" (<a href="../../images/stories/INSARAG_Guidelines_V1_Policy1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INSARAG Guidelines, Vol I, 2.1</a>). Therefore, the standards developed for the accreditation of national teams <strong>must be aligned with</strong> the INSARAG methodology and therefore should be recognized within this same framework.</p>
<p>The 2015 INSARAG Guidelines provide a very general guidance on the establishment of a national USAR team accreditation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the Guidelines, here are additional and more detailed directions and tools for the design and implementation of a national accreditation process. This guidance will be incorporated in the next update of the INSARAG Guidelines, as endorsed by the INSARAG Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: By definition, the national standards and processes shall be elaborated and promulgated at national level by the competent authority. This guidance is designed to promote the use of the INSARAG methodology by national authorities for its national teams and the national USAR response.</p>
