<p><strong>Project description:</strong></p>
<p>On request of Mongolian National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) the implementation of a USAR capacity building project on national level started in mid-2017., aiming at upgrading NEMA&rsquo;s existing Search and Rescue (SAR) capacities towards application in urban contexts (USAR), in particular Mongolia&rsquo;s capital Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>The cooperation had been initiated by an informal dialogue between NEMA, which hosted the INSARAG Asia-Pacific Earthquake Response Exercise (ERE) in June 2015, Switzerland / SDC as well as the Chinese Earthquake Administration (CEA).</p>
<p>During a first (pilot) phase of the project until end 2018, on the base of bilateral cooperation NEMA-SDC, 4 working groups of NEMA (Modular Training Ground/MTG, Equipment/Tools, Training and Management) developed &ndash; with support of the Swiss experts &ndash; the conceptual components of NEMA&rsquo;s overall USAR mechanism, including planning of the MTG. Furthermore, some new rescue tools were purchased. <br /> <br />The project will be extended latest until end 2021. The ongoing second phase (until mid-2019) mainly includes the tendering and construction of the MTG as well as basic training with the new rescue tools and consultancy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile China has established the new Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM), which integrates several already previously existing institutions, including CEA. MEM is about to join the implementation process to support NEMA together with SDC. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Project description:</strong></p>
<p>The capacity building project between SDC and its national counterparts, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which advises the Ministry of Home Affairs in the Disaster Preparedness and Response Programs, as well as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had started with first support activities in 2007 and was finalized by end 2017. <br /> <br />The aim of the cooperation had initially been to develop a centrally trained and equipped USAR entity at heavy level, in accordance with the INSARAG Guidelines, including SOPs for deployment, outdoor training facilities as well as all necessary components of a canine search dog (K9) unit. Initially it had been envisaged to achieve the INSARAG External Classification (IEC) in 2015.</p>
<p>The development of the USAR team had started in Bubaneshwar / Mundali. In July 2012 the Indian partners decided to change the location to Ghaziabad (near Delhi) in order to ease international deployment due to the vicinity of the international airport. In 2015, following some changes in the central government, the project partners shifted their focus from the development of an internationally deployable USAR entity towards capacity building on national level. Subsequently, a group of master instructors for each USAR field of Search, Rescue and Medical as well as operational leadership was trained by Swiss experts &ndash; in Mundali and finally in Ghaziabad &ndash; in several methodology courses at the various training levels learning-consolidation-application. In parallel, the canine search (K9) unit, located in Mundali, was further developed. The newly trained instructors are supposed to disseminate their know-how in the 12 NDRF Battalions countrywide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />In 2017 a large USAR training base nevertheless of impressing quality was finally constructed on the premises of the 3<sup>rd</sup> NDRF Batalion&nbsp; in Ghaziabad, just in time before concluding the project with an operational USAR exercise in November 2017.</p>
<p>In 2018 NDRF submitted a request to SDC for mentorship in view of a newly foreseen IEC. Assuming that the further development of the national capacities towards an international USAR would &ndash; beyond mentorship &ndash; lead to another intensive capacity building process, beyond SDC&rsquo;s ressources, SDC could not positively respond to the request.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, SDC recommended NDRF to apply to the INSARAG office to carry out a fact finding mission under the lead of INSARAG Asia-Pacific Region (observation and evaluation of an USAR exercise) supported &nbsp;by an international group of experts. The current state of NDRF&rsquo;s IEC-suitable USAR capacities is not evident&nbsp; to date. The mission shall provide a guidance for NDRF about the necessary steps.</p>

<p>01 Dec 2012 &ndash; 30 Jun 2013 Pre-Inception, West Bank<br />MoU, building relations, defining aims, scopes and resources. Defining baselines. Internal evaluation and recommendations.<br />01 Jul 2013 &ndash; 31 Dec 2013 Phase I, West Bank<br />Planning, identification of national Trainers (ToT), writing of national training curriculum. Defining baselines. Internal evaluation and recommendations.<br />NB: Funding is currently only available from Sida for the Pre-Inception and Phase I.<br />01 Jan 2014 &ndash; 31 Dec 2015 Phase II, West Bank<br />Implementation. Training, procurement of USAR equipment, advising on rubble field for collapsed building simulation. Yearly external and internal evaluations and recommendations.</p>
<p>Option<br />Depending on the outcomes of the above, availability of funding, and on the feasibility, the project may be implemented also for the Gaza Strip. In that case phases III and IV will be added.</p>
<p>Development goal:<br />More lives are saved in disasters involving structural collapse incidents.</p>
<p>Project purpose:<br />By supporting the Palestinian Civil Defence and relevant stakeholders in becoming self-sufficient in terms of urban search and rescue training and response, the capacity to organise a timely and effective lifesaving response in disasters involving structural collapse has been increased.</p>
<p>Desired outputs (may not be fully implemented due to current limitation of funds):</p>
<p>1. A national rescue training cadre with USAR competence has been trained and established<br />2. A national USAR training system has been created and standardised according to the national needs of oPt. This includes a printed training curricula<br />3. Linkage between the Palestinian Civil Defence and the INSARAG system has been established and is entertained over time<br />4. A USAR component has been established according to national preconditions and needs, and has been institutionalised in the national response framework<br />5. USAR equipment for the national support units and a corresponding set of equipment intended for training purposes at the Civil Defence Rescue Training Centre in Jericho has been procured<br />6. The USAR equipment has been organised in a well-functioning logistical system, with transparent responsibilities and defined maintenance procedures.<br />7. The Civil Defence Rescue Training Centre in Jericho has adequate outdoor training facilities for training in urban search and rescue.<br />Due to the current limitation of funds to the Pre-Inception and Phase I, the MSB will focus on delivering within project outputs 2 and 3 during year 2013, touching upon issues in relation to outputs 1 and 4. In case of funding becoming available for the Phase II, then all outputs will come into focus and be developed through the course of the project.</p>

<p>The project started in September 2007 and is coming to an end in December 2011. The aim is to have at least one trained and equipped USAR entity in place with SOPs for deployment as well as an outdoor training facility.</p>
<p>The USAR entities correspond to rescue groups within three existing local rescue services who were trained and equipped to respond to USAR needs. The creation of a national USAR team in accordance with the INSARAG Guidelines has only very recently been initiated, and is thought to be done after the ending of the current USAR project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gender awareness is important in USAR capacity development projects. In one of the trainings 2 out of 15 rescuers were women belonging to the local search and rescue group.</p>

			<title>INSARAG CAPACITY BUILDING ASSESSMENT MISSIONS</title>
			<link>https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/assessment-missions</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/assessment-missions</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The UN GA Resolution 57/150 of 16 December 2002 on &ldquo;Strengthening the Effectiveness and Coordination of International USAR Assistance&rdquo; stresses the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) assistance. A key factor in achieving this objective is the ongoing development of USAR capacity, especially within countries with a high risk of structural collapse from either natural or technical disasters.</p>
<p>Countries may look to develop USAR capacity for domestic purposes only, or they may look to develop capacity with the view to becoming an international donor of USAR response assistance. Either way however, countries are encouraged to develop USAR capacity in accordance with the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) Guidelines. The INSARAG Guidelines, developed and practiced by emergency responders from around the world, serve to guide international USAR teams and disaster-affected countries during international USAR response operations as well as providing guidance on how to develop USAR capacity.</p>
<p>A USAR Capacity Assessment Mission aims to identify existing capacities and determine the required capacities according to the country&rsquo;s USAR objectives. This provides an indication of the gaps between the current capacity and the required capacity which in turn assists in defining the USAR capacity development strategy.</p>
<p>The INSARAG network provides unique access to a pool of experienced, qualified USAR experts that are able to conduct an assessment of existing capacity, mapped against needs and who are then able to assist with the design and subsequent implementation of USAR Capacity Development initiatives.</p>]]></description>

			<title>INSARAG FIRST RESPONDER TRAINING</title>
			<link>https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/first-responder-training</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/first-responder-training</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Building the first tier of local capability involves the training and development of existing local emergency services and community responders to meet the needs of the affected population at the onset of the incident. Termed 'USAR First Responders', their role at the initial phase of an incident is that of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessing the nature and scale of the incident</li>
<li>Rescue and basic casualty care in the initial stages of a collapse incident</li>
<li>Providing information to domestic decision-makers about the event</li>
<li>Requesting the appropriate resources required to successfully complete the rescue phase&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>First Responder Networks would be most effective in areas where no organised USAR capability exists, as well as areas where any USAR response from structured teams may be delayed. It is envisaged that USAR First Responders will typically be personnel working in the local community or staff of local government organisations tasked with emergency management or response. For example; local police, medical staff or fire-fighters, government workers (including civil protection) or members of volunteer organisations.<br /><br />To assist in the development of USAR First Responders, INSARAG has developed the First Responders Training Package. More information regarding INSARAG First Responder Training can be found at&nbsp;the link below.</p>

			<title>National Accreditation Process</title>
			<link>https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/national-guidelines</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.insarag.org/capacity-building/national-guidelines</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The INSARAG Guidelines 2015 include a complete manual on strengthening national and local capacity building (<a href="https://www.insarag.org/images/stories/INSARAG_Guidelines_V2_Chapeau__Manual_A_-_Capacity_Building1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vol. II, Manual A</a>) and recommend countries<strong> to establish a national USAR team accreditation mechanism</strong> to allow a country to &ldquo;<em>manage, monitor and establish the same standards officially and adhere closely to the INSARAG standards and guidance in developing its USAR national response systems</em>&rdquo;. This process has been worked on particularly since 2014 in a workshop carried out in Chile on &ldquo;<a href="https://www.insarag.org/images/stories/Americas_good_practices/Sistema_acreditaci%C3%B3n_USAR_guidance_ENG_2014.09.29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The creation of a national USAR team accreditation process</a>&rdquo; and many of the lessons learned in the Americas region in the past few years have been incorporated.</p>
<p>The INSARAG Americas Regional Group presented a proposal on this topic to the INSARAG Steering Group in 2016, who in turn requested the Regional Group to lead the initiative to &ldquo;<em>design a peer revision/certification process of national USAR team accreditation processes, which confirms to the requesting country that it is complying with the minimum standards for national USAR team accreditation processes</em>&rdquo; and present recommendations back to the Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.insarag.org/global-structures/working-group/national-accreditation-working-group">National Accreditations Working Group</a>&nbsp;was created in 2016, led by the Americas Regional Group with participation from other interested countries, and the proposal developed and consulted globally throughout 2016 was endorsed by the INSARAG Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Classification vs Accreditation</strong><br />The INSARAG Guidelines 2015 make the difference between the IEC <span style="text-decoration: underline;">classification</span> &ndash; a process amongst peers, designed by the INSARAG community for the verification of the achievement of the standards for teams with an international deployment mandate; and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accreditation</span>, a process which is by definition at the national level and through which the achievement of national standards is certified by an accrediting entity, in other words, the competent national authorities.</p>
<p><strong>National accreditation process</strong><br />The USAR response framework of INSARAG shows a structure, which aims to ensure <strong>interoperability</strong> between <img src="https://www.insarag.org/images/Capacity_building/INSARAG_USAR_response_framework_ENG.png" alt="INSARAG USAR response framework ENG" width="250" height="170" style="float: right;" />different levels of USAR response and determines that "<em>it is vital that working practices, technical language and information are common and shared through all levels of the USAR response framework</em>" (<a href="https://www.insarag.org/images/stories/INSARAG_Guidelines_V1_Policy1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INSARAG Guidelines, Vol I, 2.1</a>). Therefore, the standards developed for the accreditation of national teams <strong>must be aligned with</strong> the INSARAG methodology and therefore should be recognized within this same framework.</p>
<p>The 2015 INSARAG Guidelines provide a very general guidance on the establishment of a national USAR team accreditation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the Guidelines, here are additional and more detailed directions and tools for the design and implementation of a national accreditation process. This guidance will be incorporated in the next update of the INSARAG Guidelines, as endorsed by the INSARAG Steering Group in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: By definition, the national standards and processes shall be elaborated and promulgated at national level by the competent authority. This guidance is designed to promote the use of the INSARAG methodology by national authorities for its national teams and the national USAR response.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The most successful USAR resource is one that can be in position directly following an incident of structural collapse. Understanding this, the INSARAG has committed itself to capacity building projects in countries that would likely benefit from local USAR capacity. Using the wealth of USAR experience resident in the INSARAG, the group has developed documents and courses available to countries wanting to develop local USAR capacity. It is also possible for INSARAG to arrange capacity assessment missions to countries needing review of existing systems or lack thereof.</p>
