        	<p>Following lessons identified from the urban search and rescue response to the Padang earthquake (2009) and the Haiti earthquake (2010), INSARAG has discussed to establish a technical working group looking into operational sides of coordinating urban search and rescue. In the INSARAG Steering Group Meeting, June 2010 , it was decided that an INSARAG working group should be established to further develop these aspects based on the&nbsp;<a href="../../../../images/stories/INSARAG_Haiti_Mtg_Recommendations_Report_ENG.pdf">recommendations from the INSARAG Haiti Earthquake After Action Review Meeting</a>&nbsp;of June 2010 and&nbsp;<a href="../../../../images/stories/Chairman_Summary_INSARAG_USAR_Team_Leaders_Meeting_UAE.2010.pdf">INSARAG Team Leaders Meeting</a>&nbsp;of March 2010. Therefore, the INSARAG Operations Working Group (OWG) was established in 2011 with the&nbsp;<a href="../../../../images/stories/Final__INSARAG_Steering_Group_Meeting_2011.pdf">endorsement of INSARAG Steering Group</a>.<br /><br />This newly established working group is a project-based temporary inter-regional working group with specific targets and timelines as described at its<a href="../../../../images/stories/Documents/Working_Groups/Operations_WG/ToR_OWG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Reference</a>&nbsp;. The inputs from the INSARAG regional groups are received through its participants in the working group. The groups is composed of a chair, two representatives from each INSARAG regional group and a representative of INSARAG. The group meets two to three times a year.&nbsp;The reports of this working group's meetings can be found below.</p>
